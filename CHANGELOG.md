# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Version changelogs may have an extra "Overview" section before the sections defined by *Keep a
Changelog* to more briefly describe end-user changes, while the rest of the changelog more verbosely
describes internal changes. Backwards-incompatible changes will be listed at the top of the overview
section.

Module names omit the leading `lydian.` for the sake of brevity, so if a changelog references
`cogs.voice.VoiceCog`, the fully qualified path would be `lydian.cogs.voice.VoiceCog`. The two
exceptions to this are the non-`lydian` modules `tools` and `tests`, which use their fully qualified
paths. `lydian` does not contain any modules named `tools` or `tests`, to avoid confusion.

Bot commands are referred to here using the default prefix of hyphen (`-`), replace with your
configured prefix accordingly.

  the channel or an exact count) to use `-skip` before the current track is skipped. (#16)
  - To use it, add the `[vote_skipping]` table to your `lydian-config.toml` like below and adjust
    the values as desired.

```toml
[vote_skipping]
enabled = true
threshold_type = "percentage"
percentage = 50
literal = 3
```

  the actual `discord.Member` object, which allows them to be deep-copied
- Moved `update.GH_API_ROOT`, `update.GH_REPO_API_ROOT`, and `update.USER_AGENT` to `const`
  - Value of `USER_AGENT` updated to use the package's name instead of `lydian-update-checker`

### Removed

- Removed attribute `cogs.voice.MediaItem.user`, (replaced by `.user_id`)

### Fixed

- Fixed `cogs.voice.MediaItem` objects always refreshing when advancing queue if their
  `thumbnail_url` attribute is truthy (incorrectly wrote

  `(not item.duration) or (not item.thumbnail_url)`)
- Fixed `ZoneInfo` not working correctly on systems without an IANA database by including `tzdata`
  as a dependency

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-17 [YANKED]

See notes for [v0.9.1](#091---2026-06-21). 0.9.0 was supposed to include these changes but did not
due to improper merging, and was then re-released as 0.9.1 after the git history was corrected.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-05

### Overview

> **Breaking changes**
>
> - Some TOML configuration keys are now properly nullable, using the `'n/a'` value to indicate
>   such.
>   - Config keys `max_duration`, `media_dir_warn_threshold`, `inactivity_timeout`, and
>     `lonely_timeout` now use `'n/a'` instead of `-1` or `0` to indicate they should be disabled

- Lydian can now optionally check for new releases at startup, toggled with the `check_for_updates`
  configuration key (or `LYDIAN_CHECK_UPDATES` environment variable).
  - You can check for updates manually by running `lydian-update`.
  - By default, pre-releases are skipped during this check. Set the `check_for_stable_only` config
    key to `false` to include pre-releases.
- The media queue now has a shuffle mode, use `-shuffle <on|off>` to enable or disable it.
- Lydian now includes exception arguments in "unexpected error" messages.
  - Full tracebacks are still only available in Lydian's logs.
- A temporary (deletes after 10 seconds) message is now sent when skipping a track

- The discord.py exceptions `BadArgument` and `MissingRequiredArgument` are now properly handled
- Logging methods in `cogs.voice.YTDLLogHandler` now log with `depth=2` for more accuracy

  - `COLOR_INFO` → `EMBED_COLOR_INFO`
  - `COLOR_OK` → `EMBED_COLOR_OK`
  - `COLOR_WARN` → `EMBED_COLOR_WARN`
  - `COLOR_ERROR` → `EMBED_COLOR_ERROR`
- A status message is now sent when retrieving info for a track before downloading begins (#30)
- Tool `todos` now accepts multiple directories to search
- In `tools.todos`:

    positional argument `source_dir`, still `str | Path`
- Moved function `config.env_to_bool()` to `util.FromStr.to_bool()`
- Renamed classmethod `util.FromStr.filesize()` to `util.FromStr.to_filesize()`
- Unexpected errors caught in `bot.on_command_error` now have their exception args sent along with
  the bot's message instead of only saying to check the logs

### Fixed

- Fixed `util.tabulate()` raising an error for empty data (#32)
- Fixed `todos` dev tool skipping `# TODO` lines with no author (#33)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-25

### Overview

> **Breaking changes**
>
> - TOML configuration keys now use underscores (`_`) instead of hyphens (`-`)
> - Config key `log_level` under `logging` is now `level`

- [feature] A duration limit for media items can now be set using the `max-duration` config key, which
  specifies the limit in seconds using a positive integer (setting to 0 will disable the limit)
  - `max-duration-allow-unknown` specifies whether tracks with an unknown duration can be played
    or not when a duration limit is in place, defaulting to `false`
    - If no limit is set, this key is unused and tracks of unknown duration are always allowed
    - To save time on queueing, Lydian does not fetch a track's duration until it needs to, meaning
      items queued from a playlist URL won't have their duration checked against the limit until
      they are next in line
- [feature] `lydian` can now be run with the `-V` or `--version` option to display the installed Lydian
  version and exit without starting the bot
- [feature] The "now playing" view now shows the approximate current timestamp of the playing media
  (#13)
  - Slight network delays will likely cause this number to be slightly inaccurate, but it should
    remain close enough for reference
- [fix] Fixed filesize strings in the config with single digits raising an error due to a typo in the
  regex used to match them

### Added

- Added the `-V`/`--version` option to the `lydian` package command
  - When used, Lydian's version is printed out and the script immediately exits
- Added config key `max-duration` (integer)
- Added config key `max-duration-allow-unknown` (boolean)
- Added class `config.Config.ConfigField`
- Added class `config.Config.ConfigFieldMeta`
- Added method `config.Config.set()`
- Added property `config.Config.fields`
- Added function `util.compose()`
- Added support for validator functions in `config.Config` fields, which can be given with the
  `'validators'` key of a given field's `metadata` argument as a single function or iterable of
  functions

### Changed

- Having debug mode enabled no longer forces the log level to "DEBUG" level
- `cogs.voice.MediaItem.duration_str` now returns `?:??` for an unknown duration instead of `None`
- `cogs.voice.MediaItem.embed()` now accepts an optional `timestamp` keyword argument to show the
  current time alongside its duration
- TOML configuration keys are now in `snake_case` instead of `kebab-case`; though the latter is more
  common in TOML, it's ultimately unnecessary to keep converting keys between the two cases where
  needed
- `const.LogLevel` is now an `IntEnum` subclass instead of `StrEnum`
- `config.Config` updating and loading from TOML is now handled in the class itself in a simpler
  fashion than using `util.DataclassUpdateMixin` (#26)

### Removed

- Removed mixin class `util.DataclassUpdateMixin`
  - Only used for updating the configuration object, which now handles updating in its own class

### Fixed

- Fixed single-digit filesize numbers in TOML config not matching pattern
- Queue no longer stops when encountering an error, will now skip problematic items until one can be
  played or the queue is empty (#25)

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Fixed Lydian completely failing on Windows due to an issue with a path highlighter (#28)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Added console command group `tasks`
  - `list`: Lists background tasks assigned to the bot and their status, interval, and ID
  - `start`: Attempts to start a specified background task
- Added method `console.LydianConsole.tasks_list()`
- Added method `console.LydianConsole.tasks_start()`
- Added function `util.get_background_tasks()`
- Added function `util.get_leaves()`
- Added function `util.iter_columns()`
- Added function `util.tabulate()`
- Added keypaths for every registered cog to `debug_context`, not just `voice`
  - Keys are the cog object name with the `Cog` suffix removed and lowercased,
    e.g. `GeneralCog` → `general`
- Added `tasks` and `tasklist` keys to `debug_context`
- Console command `debug read` expression argument can now be prefixed with `?` as an alias to
  `dbg.`

### Changed

- Log messages from discord.py are now properly redirected to Lydian's logger
  - Any message originating from a private function (prefixed with `_`) are overridden to be a
    "DEBUG"-level log
- `no-` prefixes in console command flags no longer invert the flag's default, instead `no-` just
  sets its value to `False` and sets `True` otherwise
- `console.BotConsole.start_loop()` now accept a `catch` parameter
  - If `True`, exceptions raised while invoking a command are logged instead of propagating them,
    allowing the console loop to continue

### Fixed

- Changed type annotation for `cogs.voice.VoiceCog.bot` to `commands.Bot` instead of
  `discord.client.Bot` to fix sphinx error
- Fixed `ValueError` raised in `util.format_duration()` when formatting `m` or `s` with `02d` since
  they can be floats
- `TypeError` and `ValueError` raised while trying to parse console command argument values are now
  caught and displayed without killing the console
- Login failures are caught properly with a custom succinct message for improper tokens, otherwise
  logs the traceback
- Fixed "flag" keyword arguments not getting parsed correctly by the console

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- `-clear` now removes the stopped track as well
- `config.Config.from_toml()` and `config.Config.update_from_toml()` both now expect a
  TOML-formatted string instead of a file path
- Debug command `debug read` can now access the new global `perms` object
- Running the `lydian` command without a `lydian-config.toml` present will now offer to create
  `.env` and enter your token in addition to creating the TOML and `permissions.yml` files
- `config.Config` fields' `metadata` dictionary now expects the `converter` key in place of
  `envcov`, and will be used more generally
- Config key `max-filesize` now additionally accepts a string of a value and unit, like `"50 MB"` or
  `1gb`
- Renamed `const.console` to `const.screen` to further separate it from the newly added `BotConsole`

- Added attribute `cogs.voice.YTDLSource.file`
- Added attributes to `cogs.voice.VoiceCog`:
  - `inactive`: (`bool`) Whether the bot is "inactive", as in no media is being played and
    the queue is empty (the bot being paused still counts as playing in this context)
  - `alone`: (`bool`) Whether the bot is the only user in the voice channel it is connected to
  - `since_inactive`: (`int`) How many seconds have passed since `inactive` has been `True`
  - `since_alone`: (`int`) How many seconds have passed since `alone` has been `True`

### Changed

- `-queue` command is now paginated, accepts an optional page index value and shows up to 20 items
  per page (#11)
- `cogs.voice.MediaQueue` is now a subclass of `UserList` rather than a `deque`
  - Now accepts an `initlist` parameter
- `cogs.voice.MediaItem` embeds now show the user that queued it, if one is set
- `cogs.voice.MediaItem.from_url` now returns a tuple of `MediaItem` objects instead of one
- `cogs.voice.MediaItem.from_url` now takes an optional `user` parameter
- `cogs.voice.VoiceCog.advance_queue()` now returns `Exception | None`
- `config.Config.update_from_toml()` parameter `missing_ok` renamed to `on_missing`, accepts the values `'raise'`,
  `'warn'`, or `'continue'`

### Removed

- Removed unused event constant `cogs.voice.EV_PLAYER_STOPPED_BY_COMMAND`
- Removed method `cogs.voice.MediaQueue.appendleft()`
  - Use `.insert(0, x)` instead; while technically slower than a deque, testing with `timeit` shows
    inserting to the front of a 10,000 length list still only takes some ~0.0016 seconds, which is
    more than acceptable

### Fixed

- Fixed error raised when calling `util.setup_logger()` after its already been called once due to
  setting the `CONSOLE` log level number
- `util.DataclassUpdateMixin.update()` now properly checks that the value for a `Literal`-typed
  field is correct

  `loguru`'s logging
  - See: <https://github.com/Delgan/loguru/issues/1385>
- Lydian's data directory is no longer created when importing `const`
- All command definitions which used aliases now use the `cogs.util.alias_from_config` decorator
- Log messages now include timezone
- `util.dirsize()` now includes the 4096 bytes per each directory in its returned size
- `tests/tmp` is now cleared on test session start
- Renamed function `cli.latest()` to `cli.logs_latest()`
- Renamed function `cogs.voice.Voice.clear` to `clear_queue`

### Removed

- Removed constant `const.TOKEN_PATH`
- Removed function `bot.get_token()`
- Removed function `const.log_file_filter()`

### Fixed

- Exceptions raised inside of `bot.on_command_error` are now logged and not silently ignored
- yt-dlp error logs (calls to the `.error()` method of its logger) are now properly handled
- Command hook method `cogs.voice.VoiceCog.auto_join()` now correctly raises `AbortCommand` when the
  author is not a guild member instead of returning
