# Lydian / Configuration

Lydian has many settings available to customize and configure your bot. To use them, create a `config.yml` file in the bot's directory. Here you'll enter any config "keys" that you wish to change, which will then override the default value for that option.

As an example, if you wanted to change the bot's prefix from the default `-` to `!`, you would write this into `config.yml`...

```yml
prefixes:
    public: "!"
```

...which will override the default value. When a setting is contained within another, like above, that's called **nesting**, and it is important to **indent** nested options just like they are presented in `config_default.yml`. When writing these, you can use `#` before text to write a **comment**, which will be ignored by the bot, and can be used as personal notes.

For a more complete example, your `config.yml` may look something like this:

```yml
embed-color: "0000ff" # blue
duration-limit: 2 # 2 hours
inactivity-timeout: 5 # 5 minutes
aliases:
    move:
        - "mv"
# comments can also be on their own separate lines, like this
vote-to-skip:
    enabled: true
    threshold-percentage: 50
    threshold-type: "percentage"
```

## Glossary

Written in alphabetical order. All information below should be accurate as of version **2.0.0**.

### `album-track-limit`

> Prevents queueing an album longer than this limit.


**Valid options:** any positive number

**Example:**

```yaml
album-track-limit: 20
```

### `aliases`

> Alternate names that commands can be triggered with.

**Valid options:** any command name, with a nested list of alias strings within it

**Example:**

```yaml
aliases:
    move:
        - "m"
        - "mv"
```

### `allow-playlists-albums`

> Allow or prevent the queueing of entire playlists / albums.
> *NOTE: The bot will generally try its best to distinguish between a user-made playlist and an actual album, but the process isn't guaranteed to work, hence both being controlled by one configuration key.*

**Valid options:** `true` or `false`

**Example:**

```yaml
allow-playlists-albums: true
```

### `auto-remove`

> A list of file extensions to automatically delete files of, upon each startup of the bot. Media files are automatically removed after playing them, but occasionally if the bot if interrupted they can remain, so this is used to clean them up.

**Valid options:** a list of any file extensions, preceded with a period/dot

**Example:**

```yaml
auto-remove:
    - ".mp3"
    - ".webm"
```

### `command-blacklist`

> Disables any of the listed commands.

**Valid options:** a list of command names (as strings)

**Example:**

```yaml
command-blacklist:
    - "clear"
    - "join"
```

### `duration-limit`

> An amount of **hours** that queued tracks should be limited by. i.e, any song over this length will be blocked from playing.

**Valid options**: any positive number

**Example:**

```yaml
duration-limit: 2
```

### `embed-color`

> A hex code for the bot's message sidebar color.

**Valid options:** a string containing a valid color hex code

**Example:**

```yaml
embed-color: "ff00aa"
```

### `force-match-prompt`

> Forces the bot to think its not found any Spotify-YouTube match, thus bringing up the choice prompt every time. *This is primarily used for **debugging**, and should be left turned off in most cases.*

**Valid options:** `true` or `false`

**Example:**

```yaml
force-match-prompt: false
```

### `inactivity-timeout`

> A duration in **minutes** of bot inactivity (not actively playing any audio) that it should leave the voice channel after.

**Valid options:** any positive number

**Example:**

```yaml
inactivity-timeout: 10
```

### `logging-options`

> A key containing various options regarding how the bot will log its status out to the console. All of these options are only for customizing what you see in your command prompt or terminal — regardless of what you set here, everything will be saved in `lydian.log` for troubleshooting.

### `logging-options` → `console-log-level`

> Sets the "log level" for what you see in the console. Shows any logs including and higher than that level's priority.

**Valid options:** In order of ascending priority: "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"

**Example:**

```yaml
logging-options:
    console-log-level: "INFO"
```

### `logging-options` → `log-full-tracebacks`

> Whether to log the entire traceback upon encountering an error. Again, tracebacks are still saved to the logfile no matter what, this only toggles them in the console window.

**Valid options:** `true` or `false`

**Example:**

```yaml
logging-options:
    log-full-tracebacks: false
```

### `logging-options` → `colors`

> Allows you to specify colors for certain types of keywords within logs. Also contains the `no-color` key which will disable colored logging altogether.

**Valid options:** a color name that is any of the following...

        debug: "green"
        info: "white"
        warn: "gold"
        error: "red"
        critical: "red on white"
        timer: "white" # Used for the time/date
        module: "blue" # For module names (bot.py, media.py, etc.)
        function: "yellow" # For function names
```

### `maximum-file-size`

```yaml
maximum-file-size: 10 # 10 MB
```

### `maximum-urls`

> Maximum number of links that can be queued with one `-play` command.

**Valid options:** any positive number

prefixes:
    public: "!"
    developer: "%"
```

### `public`

> Starts the bot in "public" mode if set to true, or "developer" mode if set to false. Developer mode will make the bot use the [developer prefix](#prefixes), and will enable developer-only [console commands](https://github.com/svioletg/lydian-discord-bot/blob/main/docs/console.md).

```

### `vote-to-skip` → `threshold-type`

> How vote-skipping should function, by percentage or a defined total.

**Valid options:** `"percentage"` or `"exact"`

**Example:**

```yaml
vote-to-skip:
    threshold-type: "percentage"
```

### `vote-to-skip` → `threshold-percentage`

> The percentage of users (out of the total users present in the voice channel) that need to use `-skip` before the track will be skipped. Only needed if `threshold-type` is set to `"percentage"`.

**Valid options:** any positive number
